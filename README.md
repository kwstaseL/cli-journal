### 3. Requirements

To build and run CLI Journal locally (outside Docker), youâ€™ll need:
* Go 1.20+ installed and in your PATH
* Make (for the build command)
* If you want to inspect your DB manually, you need to also have [SQLite CLI](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html)

### 4. Database
CLI Journal uses SQLite to store notes locally. The database file will be created at:
```bash
data/notes.db
```
If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

### 5. Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kwstaseL/cli-journal.git
cd cli-journal
```

Build the application:

```bash
make build
```

Create a .env file based on the sample:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Run the application:

```bash
./cli-journal
```
